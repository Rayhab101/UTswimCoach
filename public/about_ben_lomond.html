            <div class="about"><h3>Ben Lomond's Swim Team </h3>The Ben Lomond swim team was established in the late 1960's and has many great seasons and region championships under its belt. While the team has gone through multiple coaches, records, and a few pool renovations over the years, the Scots spirit continues to thrive in every swimmer's heart; both past and present. The swim team has made an great impact within every region they've been apart of. They have done so by welcoming every school with open arms and making them feel welcome while at their home pool. <div style="font-size: x-small; padding-top: 10px;">The 2020-21 Ben Lomond Swim Team</div><img class="team_pic" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="ben_lomond_team.png"></div>
