                <h3>Saint Joseph's Swim Team </h3>
                The Saint Joseph's swim team had a great 5th season while swimming with the Ben Lomond High School team. While the student population of the school is small itself, the team had one of their largest groups in the history of the program (10). Each individual excelled in many of the events and most of the school records were broken.
